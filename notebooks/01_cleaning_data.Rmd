title: "Pre-Analysis F1 Data"
output:
  pdf_notebook:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true

---

The purpose of this notebook is to clean the F1 data so I can work with it for my analysis of winning teams.

Let's first load the right libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
And our data:
```{r}
race_results <- read_csv("../data/race_results_statsf1.csv")
head(race_results)
```

## Looking at the data before we clean 

With this dataset, we have the following columns:

1.`race_id`: The number of the race. 1 is the first race in F1, and the biggest number is the last race of 2019 as of now.
2. `year`: The year the F1 season took place. Races for a season happened in 1 calendar year.
3. `round`: The order of the race for that year. 1 is the first race for a season, 2 is the second, and so on.  
4. `race_name`: Name of the country where the Grand Prix race was held.  
5. `position`: The finishing position value scraped from Stats F1. There are both number finishes and a series of characters & abbreviations. I tried to interpret these in the `p_prelim` column based on the abbreviations [here](https://www.statsf1.com/en/saisons.aspx)  
6. `p_prelim`: The interpreted numerical finishing position based on the `position` column. There might need to be some rechecking of what things mean in this column, and a new name.  
7. `driver`: the name of the driver. Last name is in All-caps.  
8. `team`: the name of the car manufacturer the driver raced in in a particular race. Also known as the constructor.
9. `constructor_long`: the combination of the team name and the engine test.
10. `extra`: extra information like finishing times, lap times, and reasons for retiring, withdrawing, or being removed from a race.

## Explore & Verify variables

Let's go variable by variable, see what's there and then try to make notes of how we might clean this.

### `race_id`

Let's look at just this variable right now:
```{r}
max(race_results["race_id"])
```
Looking at this variable, the biggest value currently is `r max(race_results["race_id"])`. I know the 2019 Chinese GP was the 1000th race. If I count from that race in the [2019 Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship#Calendar) the 21st race of the season, the Abu Dhabi GP, was the 1018th race. These numbers check out moving forward from 2019 to the most recent F1 season, 2021. 

So that looks good.

### `year`

```{r}
summary(race_results["year"])
```
So the years column looks fine. We should only have data for 1950 to 2021. 2022 season is underway.
 
### `round`

This corresponds to the order of the race in each season. We could check it by seeing how many races there were each year.

```{r}
race_results %>% 
  select(year, round) %>% 
  distinct(year, round) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(races_count = n())
```

Let's try to visualize that, by first saving all that previous code to a variable:

```{r}
annual_races_count <- race_results %>% 
                      select(year, round) %>% 
                      distinct(year, round) %>% 
                      group_by(year) %>% 
                      summarise(races_count = n())

ggplot(annual_races_count, aes(x=year, y=races_count))+
         geom_line() + labs(y="Number of races")
```

The first season had 7 races and over time, we got more races. It'd be interesting to explore **why** the number of races went up. (It's a result of marketing and sponsorship, but it'd be cool to see what the changes meant.)

### `race_name`

`race_name` refers to the country where races were held. Let's explore this variable to see what country has hosted the most races:

```{r}
race_results %>% select(race_name) %>% 
  group_by(race_name) %>% summarize(count = n())
```

Looking at just the race names is difficult. So let's look at the race_name and year.

```{r}
race_results %>% select(year, race_name) %>% 
                  distinct(year, race_name) %>% 
                  group_by(race_name) %>% 
                  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
                  arrange(desc(count))
```

Italy and Britain have hosted the most races. If we look at the data though there's some weirdness like there being USA, USA East, USA West, Indianapolis, and Las Vegas as all being Grand Prixs that happened in America. For my analysis where I'm looking at team performance, I don't mind this issue as much, but good to note it now.

If I cared about this variable, I might make a new variable for country and create the values for that variable based on this variable.

### `position`

The driver's finishing position. It's either a number or a alphanumeric code with definitions [here](https://www.statsf1.com/en/saisons.aspx). Just in case let's try to explain them:

* ab: Retired
* nc : Not classified
* np : Not started
* nq : Not qualified
* npq : Not pre-qualified
* dsq : Disqualified
* exc : Excluded
* f : Withdrawal
* tf : Parade lap

To really understand these, I'd read up on races where these symbols showed up. I'll save that for a later day

**TODO**: Find out the best explanation of what each of the above codes mean with examples.

### `p_prelim`

My interpretation of the position column. I need to verify this thoroughly to explain the logic I took when I scraped. But I might just create a new column based on the position column.

```{r}
summary(race_results["p_prelim"])
```
`-1` here means the driver was disqualified.

**TODO**: Figure out what the logic for this part was and try to make sure it's correct.

**TODO**: Rename column

### `driver`

The driver's name. Most of them got scraped well but not all. Would be a good idea to clean the messed up one. We can check which ones need cleaning by seeing how many times each driver competed in F1.

```{r message=FALSE}
race_results %>% select(race_id, driver) %>% 
                  distinct(race_id, driver) %>%
                  group_by(driver) %>% 
                  summarize(count = n()) %>%
                  arrange(desc(count))
```

Looking at the list, the names that need to be fixed are:
* `Andr� GUELFI` to `André GUELFI`  
* `Andr� LOTTERER` to `André LOTTERER`  
* `Andr� MILHOUX`	to `André MILHOUX`  
* `Andr� PILETTE` to `André PILETTE`  
* `Andr� SIMON` to `André SIMON`  
* `Andr� TESTUT` to `André TESTUT`  
* `Azdr�bal BAYARDO` to `Azdrúbal BAYARDO`  
* `Eug�ne CHABOUD` to `Eugène CHABOUD`  
* `Eug�ne MARTIN` to `Eugène MARTIN`  
* `Fran�ois CEVERT` to `François CEVERT`  
* `Fran�ois HESNAULT` to `François HESNAULT`  
* `Fran�ois MAZET` to `François MAZET`  
* `Fran�ois MIGAULT` to `François MIGAULT`  
* `G�nther BECHEM` to `Günther BECHEM`  
* `G�rard LARROUSSE` to `Gérard LARROUSSE`  
* `Jean-�ric VERGNE` to `Jean-Éric VERGNE`  
* `Jos� DOLHEM` to `José DOLHEM`  
* `J�r�me d'AMBROSIO` to `Jérôme d'AMBROSIO`  
* `Peter ST�CHELIN` to `Peter STÆCHELIN`  
* `Ren� ARNOUX` to `René ARNOUX`  
* `S�bastien BOURDAIS` to `Sébastien BOURDAIS`  
* `St�phane SARRAZIN` to `Stéphane SARRAZIN`  
* `S�bastien BUEMI` to `Sébastien BUEMI`  
* `Tom BELS�` to `Tom BELSØ`  

**TODO**: Fix driver names

### `team`

The name of the team the driver was driving for. The team is the one producing the car so they're also called constructor.

**TODO:** Rename column to constructor.

Let's look at what teams have been around:
```{r message=FALSE}
race_results %>% select(race_id, team)%>%
                  distinct(race_id, team) %>%
                  group_by(team) %>% 
                  summarize(count = n())
```

**TODO**: Figure out what those `*` next to some teams mean. How should we deal with those? Some examples we have are `Brabham *`, `Cooper *`, `Ferrari *`, `Lola *`, `Lotus *`, `Matra *`, `Porsche *`,`Protos *`, `Tecno *`, `Tojeiro *`.

**TODO**: Fix team names like `Ekstr�m`

There were some `NA` for rows that had `position == '&'`. We should fill with the value from above

**TODO**: Fill the team values that were `NA`.

### `constructor_long`

The combination of constructor and engine. Let's look at them:
```{r}
select(race_results, race_id, constructor_long)%>%
  distinct(race_id, constructor_long) %>%
  group_by(constructor_long) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
```
I don't particularly care about this column, so there is no real need to clean it at the moment.

### `extra`

This column contains a variety of extra information like finishing times, lap times, and reasons for not finishing a race among other things. This column should definitely be cleaned up of the extra broken characters, because it might be good to look at the common reasons for not finishing a race. We would definitely have to find a way of getting rid of the lap times and such.

**TODO**: Clear random characters.

## Cleaning Data

While verifying the variables, I've left a list of **TODO**s to look at. Let's try to address the following in cleaning.

1. For `position`:
    * Find out the best explanation of what each of the above codes mean with examples.
2. For `p_prelim`:
    * Rename the column to be something like `position_numeric`.
    * Figure out what the logic for this part was and try to make sure it's correct.
3. For `driver`: 
    * Fix names
4. For `team`:
    * Rename column to `constructor`.
    * Figure out what those `*` next to some teams mean. How should we deal with those? Some examples we have are `Brabham *`, `Cooper *`, `Ferrari *`, `Lola *`, `Lotus *`, `Matra *`, `Porsche *`,`Protos *`, `Tecno *`, `Tojeiro *`.
    * Fix team names like `Ekstr�m`
    * Fill the team values that were `NA`.
5. For `extra`:
    * Remove random character.


### Updating `p_prelim`

#### Scraping logic
`p_prelim` is an interpretation of `position` to have all the drivers listed in numerical order. The script I used to get this data is in my `scripts` folder at: `/scripts/get_race_results_statsf1.py`.

Initially, I worked with this logic: 

```
if position == "&":
    # driver finish tied to previous row
    p = p_index - 1
elif position == "dsq":
    # driver disqualified
    p = -1
else: 
    p = max(p_index, p_index-1)
    p_index += 1
```

As the script ran, it would go result by result. The first result would get `p_index` of `1`. `p_index` was a variable that was saved as `p_prelim`. The next result would be `p_index` of `2`. This worked great for numeric. If the position was `&` the result referred to a shared drive so the driver should have the same `p_index` as the previous result. For disqualified drivers, I set `p_index` to `-1`. That seemed to work for most of my data.

#### Logic I previously used.

This seemed to work to a degree, but I wanted something to work a little better. Looking at the results previously (check `attempt04` in my archive which has the analysis for the 1950 through 2018 seasons that I used in my first draft of capstone work.)

* If the position is a number (in string form or otherwise) then that is the finishing position of the driver.
* If the position is `&` then that driver record is for a shared drive and the finishing position of that driver is the same as the record directly above it.
* If the position is `ab` then the driver retired during the race. The later they retired, the higher they ranked.
* If the position is `nc` the driver did not classify for the final positions, but did complete most of the race. They get ranked in the order they finished.
* If the position is `np` then the driver did not start the race, but was on the grid. They will be ranked as the last possible spot.
* If the position is `dsq`, the driver was disqualified and their finishing position will be the the last possible spot + 1.
* If the position is `f` then the driver withdrew from a race. Let's set it to `0`.
* If the position is `npq`, `nq`, `tf`,or `exc` the driver's order will be ignored. Let's set it to `0`.

We can write little code chunks to address each of these points. 

### Creating `position_numeric`
Let's update the p_prelim for the cases where `position` is `f` or `np`. We'll create a new column,`position_numeric_last_place`, for this evaluation.
```{r}
ptm <- proc.time()

get_last <- function(some_race_id) {
  last <- race_results %>%
    select(race_id, position, driver) %>%
    filter(race_id == some_race_id) %>%
    distinct(race_id,driver) %>%
    summarise(count=n()) %>%
    pull(count)
  return(last)
}

race_results_cleaning <- race_results %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(position_numeric_a =
           case_when(position == "np" |
                       position == "f" ~
                       get_last(race_id)))
# Check how long this chunk took
run_time <- proc.time() - ptm
```

Let's update the disqualified drivers, where `position == "dsq"`. This should be the last place plus 1.
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(position_numeric_b =
           case_when(position == "dsq" ~
               as.integer(get_last(race_id) + 1)))
```

Let's try combining these two:

```{r}
rr2 <- race_results_cleaning %>% unite("position_numeric", position_numeric_a, position_numeric_b, na.rm=TRUE)
```
Later we can update the column to be numeric. So this is a good test.

Let's keep interpreting the position columns and later combining them. Next we'll do the position values we're setting to zero: `npq`, `nq`, `tf`,and `ex`.

```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(position_numeric_c =
           case_when(position %in% 
                       c("npq","nq", "tf", "exc") ~
                       as.integer(0)))
```

And for some of the other position values we can just pass the p_prelim value forward.
```{r}
get_finish <- function(some_race_id, some_driver) {
  finish <- race_results %>%
    select(race_id, p_prelim, driver) %>%
    filter(race_id == some_race_id, driver == some_driver) %>%
    pull(p_prelim)
}

race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(position_numeric_d = list(case_when(
    position == "&" ~ 
      as.integer(get_finish(race_id, driver))
    )))
```

Looking at this, we have an issue. When there are shared results, and we try to identify the single value in the get_finish function we end up with two, making an issue. So we need to add some sort of result_id to identify each line uniquely.'

```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% add_column(result_id=1:nrow(race_results_cleaning))
```
Now let's try that again:

```{r}
get_finish <- function(some_result_id) {
  finish <- race_results_cleaning %>%
    select(result_id, p_prelim) %>%
    filter(result_id == some_result_id) %>%
    pull(p_prelim)
  return(finish)
}

race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(position_numeric_d2 = case_when(
    position == "&" ~
      as.integer(get_finish(result_id))
    ))
```

That looks good. Let's finish by creating a fifth `position_numeric_*` column. We'll use it for the last cases. Passing the `p_prelim` values for rows where `position` is a number or `ab` or `nc`.

```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(position_numeric_e = case_when(
    position %in% c("ab","nc") |
    !(position %in% c( "&","ab", "nc", "np",
                      "nq", "npq", "dsq",
                      "exc", "f", "tf")) ~
      as.integer(get_finish(result_id))
    ))
```

Now we can move to combining all those different `position_numeric_*` into one.

```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% unite("position_numeric", position_numeric_a, position_numeric_b, position_numeric_c,position_numeric_d2, position_numeric_e, na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  select(-position_numeric_d)

```
Before we move on, let's turn the `position_numeric` into a double. We can also get rid of `p_prelim` since we have interpreted the `position`.
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
        mutate(position_numeric =
                 as.double(position_numeric)) %>%
        select(-p_prelim)
```


Next up, let's move to fixing the names.

### Fixing `driver` names

There are a lot of names that loaded funny because of some encoding issue. Let's try to rename them and save to make sure that the names are fixed.

Previously I had listed all the names that had to change. They can be more quickly summarized as:
* `Andr�` to `André`
* `Azdr�bal` to `Azdrúbal`
* `Eug�ne` to `Eugène`  
* `Fran�ois` to `François`
* `G�nther` to `Günther`  
* `G�rard` to `Gérard`  
* `Jean-�ric` to `Jean-Éric`  
* `Jos�` to `José`  
* `J�r�me` to `Jérôme`  
* `ST�CHELIN` to `STÆCHELIN`  
* `Ren�` to `René`  
* `S�bastien` to `Sébastien`  
* `St�phane` to `Stéphane`  
* `BELS�` to `BELSØ`  

```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% 
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "Andr�","André")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "Azdr�bal","Azdrúbal")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "Eug�ne","Eugène")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "Fran�ois","François")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "G�nther","Günther")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "G�rard","Gérard")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "Jean-�ric","Jean-Éric")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "Jos�","José")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "J�r�me","Jérôme")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "ST�CHELIN","STAECHELIN")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "Ren�","René")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "S�bastien","Sébastien")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "St�phane","Stéphane")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "BELS�","BELSØ")) %>%
  mutate(driver = str_replace(driver, "S�bastien","Sébastien"))
```

### Looking at `team`

Looking at this column:
* I want to go and clean it up a little bit. I want to rename the column from `team` to `constructor` because that's the term used in F1. I also want to figure out what the `*` in some constructor names were.
* I want to investigate the teams that have an `*` in their name.
* I want to fill in the `team` and `constructor_long` for the rows with shared drives.

#### Filling in `team` and `constructor_long`

We can first replace the missing teams with `fill()`.
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% fill(team, .direction="down")
```

To add in the missing `constructor_long`, let's try the following:
```{r}
rr2 <- race_results_cleaning %>% 
          select(position, constructor_long) %>% 
          mutate(constructor_long = case_when(
            position == "&" ~ lag(constructor_long),
            TRUE ~ constructor_long))
```

That works, so let's do it to the actual cleaning.

```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
          mutate(constructor_long = case_when(
            position == "&" ~ lag(constructor_long),
            TRUE ~ constructor_long))
```


#### `*` in the name
I picked a particular race where teams with `*` showed up, the 1958 German Grand Prix. Looking at the [results on Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/1958/allemagne/classement.aspx), the `*` is a note that those drivers were racing Formula Two cars in Formula One. For some analysis, this distinction might be important so we could proceed with two different ways:

1. Remove the `*` if we don't care that the cars were F2 cars.
2. Remove those rows, if we care that the cars were F2 cars. 

I particularly don't care too much that the cars were F2 so I'll remove the asterisk. But before that I'll add a column to mark whether the car is F1 or F2, in case I want to look at that distinction later.

```{r}
rr2 <- race_results_cleaning %>% select(year, race_name, team) %>% rowwise() %>%
  mutate(is_F1_car = str_detect(team, "\\*", negate= TRUE))
```

Let's add that column to our main data:
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% rowwise() %>%
  mutate(is_F1_car = str_detect(team, "\\*", negate= TRUE))
```

And now we can remove the `*` from both the team and `constructor_long` columns:
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
  mutate(team = str_replace(team," \\*","")) %>%
  mutate(team = str_squish(team)) %>%
  mutate(constructor_long = str_replace(constructor_long," \\*","")) %>%
  mutate(constructor_long = str_squish(constructor_long))
```

Let's also fix the team `Ekstr�m`
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% 
  mutate(team = str_replace(team, "Ekstr�m","Ekström")) %>%
  mutate(constructor_long = str_replace(constructor_long, "Ekstr�m","Ekström"))
```

And finally we can rename the team column to `constructor`
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% rename(constructor = team)
```

### Cleaning the `extra` column

There's a lot I want to do here. I don't care about lap times really. I wish I could select them and delete them. For now, I'll settle on just removing the extra characters:
```{r}
rr2 <- race_results_cleaning %>% 
        select(extra) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", ""))
```

While they may all look the same, they are indeed very different sets of random characters. Let's do it in the main data:
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", "")) %>%
        mutate(extra = str_replace(extra, "�", ""))
```


### Looking at racing location
Let's make that column for race countries... because, why not. Looking at all the race_names, they are mostly good except some odd cases.
* European was held in various countries based on year [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Grand_Prix#As_an_honorific_title)
* There have been 5 different grand prixs in America.
* Pacific GP was in Japan
* Abu Dhabi GP is in UAE
* Both Pescara and San Marino GP are in Italy

```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% 
  mutate(race_country = case_when(
    race_name == "Britain" ~ "England",
    race_name %in% c("USA West", "USA East",
                     "Las Vegas", "Indianapolis") ~ "USA",
    race_name == "Pacific" ~ "Japan",
    race_name == "Abu Dhabi" ~ "UAE",
    race_name %in% c("Pescara", "San Marino") ~ "Italy",
    race_name == "Europe" & year %in% c(1983, 1985,1993) ~ "England",
    race_name == "Europe" & year %in% c(1984, 1995, 1996, 1999,
                                        2000, 2001, 2002,2003,
                                        2004,2005,2006,2007) ~ "Germany",

## Saving the clean data

Now that I've cleaned things as far as I can do now, let me save it to a CSV:
```{r}
race_results_cleaning <- race_results_cleaning %>% select(result_id,
                                                          race_id,
                                                          year,
                                                          round,
                                                          race_name,
                                                          race_country,
                                                          driver,
                                                          position,
                                                          position_numeric,
                                                          constructor,
                                                          constructor_long,
                                                          extra,
                                                          is_F1_car
                                                          )
write_csv(race_results_cleaning, "../data/race_results_clean.csv", append=FALSE)
```
