# FormulaOne Analysis

Data and analysis for my F1 capstone project while at Newhouse.

## Python requirements

To run the scripts for getting F1 data, make sure to have the following packages installed: `bs4`, `requests`, and `lxml`.

Maybe run this command, or a variant that works for you:
`python3 -m pip install bs4 requests lxml`

## Data analysis

Data was first analyzed using Jupyter notebooks (see [archive](./archive/) folder). More recent analysis and cleaning is done using R and RStudio because it's easier to combine comments and work within the platform.

We do need to have the `tidyverse` installed in RStudio to clean the data.
