# FormulaOne Analysis

Data and analysis for my F1 capstone project while at Newhouse.

## Requirements

To run the scripts for getting F1 data, make sure to have the following packages installed: `bs4`, `requests`, and `lxml`.

Maybe run this command, or a variant that works for you:
`python3 -m pip install bs4 requests lxml`
